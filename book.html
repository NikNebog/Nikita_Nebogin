            <p> In the cartoons, Lightning is sponsored by "Rusty" and has stickers of its sponsor. It is not based on any car, because McQueen is a collective image, but most of all he has features from the Chevrolet Corvette C6 and Dodge Viper. Its body is painted red with yellow and orange zipper stickers with its racing number on the sides. His appearance changes, but generally retains the same image. Lightning is briefly shown without paint or stickers in "Cars 3".</p>
